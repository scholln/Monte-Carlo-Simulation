# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
My final project for my Monte Carlo simulation using population health data to run health based simulations


## What is a Monte Carlo simulation?

A monte carlo simulaton is best described as using random sampling, random numbers or variables you are uncertain about to try and assess possible outcomes for that given situation.  It has been used for physics, financial investment, and AI development for situations that involve decision making and not a percise data set to utilize for it.

Here is an example of a Monte Carlo graph I pulled:

## What am I using the simulation for?

I am using the monte carlo simulation for population health analysis and assessment of certain factors such disease, genetics, and healthcare interventions. I am actually generating this data using population statistics given by my company to utilize.  Think of it as actually spawning the data set itself and then coming to conlcusions like:
- This portion of the public has heart disease
- Another portion has an alergic reaction to certain foods like nuts, gluten, etc.
- We can see that this demographic is more likely to experience this disease

MiHIN would like to utilize this data set and analysis as a selling point to future customers as a way to communicate "Look what we can do when given this healthcare data and what we can give you in return".  Another goal of this data set would be for future use and analysis, this would include being used to test out applications in development or new business procedures.

## Now, why am *I* doing this?

I started working for healthcare IT back when I first graduated from college in 2019 and I have loved every step of this journey.  Healthcare IT services are a big need to help keep the cost of healthcare for the general public, the state, and providers low and provide the best possible service for such parties.  I got my undegraduate degree in Mathematics, I mention that because I have developed a love and passion for all fields under the math umbrella but especially for probability and statistics.  Monte Carlo is based upon probablity and statistics, this is a great way to include my love of math and develop skills as a data scientist.

**PLEASE NOTE**
> This data set that I am working with is synthetic.  Meaning, the data is fake.  The reason why it is fake is because of HIPAA privacy rule that was put into place by congress in 1996.  What this means in this case is that I cannot share anyone's healthcare data for this project and thus the work around is using synthetic data that is meant to mimic real data.
